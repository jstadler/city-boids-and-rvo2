city_boids_and_rvo2
===================

The project is an OpenGL implementation that combines the boids flocking algoritm and the rvo2 crowd and collision avoidance algorithm together in a city scene.  The scene is a basic intersection with pedestrians navigating from one location to another.  The pedestrains are managed with RVO2.  A flock of birds flies around above the park.  The bird flock is managed with the boids flocking algorithm.
